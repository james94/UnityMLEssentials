# Unity ML Agent Essentials

These are the Unity RL/{ML,DL} Agent Essentials based on Dilmer Velecillo's YouTube tutorials. However, he used Unity ML Agents package 1.0.2 in Unity 2019.3.5f1 <DX11> on Windows. I updated his C# code to work with ML Agents package 2.3.0 in Unity 2021.3.13f1 <OpenGL 4.5> on Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS

- Here is Dilmer's video on [Unity Machine Learning - How To Track A Target (Observations, Actions, Heuristic, And Training)](https://youtu.be/Gpesx2-TCuA)

- Here is my version of it for Unity 2021.3.13f1 <OpenGL 4.5> on Ubuntu 20.04.4: [Basic_Path_Planning](Basic_Path_Finding)
